## Tasks

A list of the recommended tasks to complete the project:

1. Setting up the Project. First we will have to download our data and make sure our directory is set up for Jupyter notebook.
2. Setting up your Git Repository. Create a new Git repository for this project.
3. Load the Data with pd.read_csv(filename.csv)and check the first few rows (data.head())
4. Project Scoping .Properly scoping your project will greatly benefit you; scoping creates structure while requiring you to think through your entire project before you begin. You should start with stating the goals for your project, then gathering the data, and considering the analytical steps required. A proper project scope can be a great road map for your project, but keep in mind that some down-stream tasks may become dead ends which will require adjustment to the scope.
5. Explore and Explain Data. Once you have your data, it’s a good idea to get acquainted with it. You should show some summary statistics and visually examine your data. Don’t forget to write out some insights that you have gained along with your analysis.
6. Conclusions. Finally we can wrap up the project. You can write a conclusion about your process and findings.
7. Create a Blog Post. Once you’ve performed your analysis, you’re ready to create your blog post.
